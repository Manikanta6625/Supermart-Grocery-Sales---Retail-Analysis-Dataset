# 🛒 Supermart Grocery Sales Analysis Project
## 📌 Project Overview
The **Supermart Grocery Sales Analysis** project focuses on understanding retail performance through sales data analysis. The project highlights insights related to product categories, customer segments, regional trends, profit contribution, and discount impact. The goal is to assist retail decision-making, improve business efficiency, and increase profitability through data-driven strategies.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Analyze sales and profit patterns by category, sub-category, and region.
* Identify high-performing and low-performing product segments.
* Evaluate customer segment purchase behavior.
* Understand discount vs profit relationship and pricing impact.
* Develop a dashboard for interactive business intelligence.

## 🧠 Key Insights

* Certain product subcategories significantly contribute to revenue but not profit due to high discount impact.
* Technology and Office Supplies categories show strong revenue share with better margins.
* Discounts heavily affect profitability — higher discounts lead to loss in several categories.
* West and East regions show higher overall sales performance compared to South and Central.
* Consumer customer segment accounts for the largest portion of total sales.
